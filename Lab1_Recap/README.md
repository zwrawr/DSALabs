# Lab 1 : C Recap

## Info
*I skipped lab one , because it was a recap.*

## Introduction

    This module uses the C programming language to implement many of the data structures and algorithms discussed during lectures. The final assessment is also to be written in C. Therefore it is important that you are comfortable with the C programming language. Specifically, structures, pointers and dynamic memory management. This lab aims to recap these necessary C programming topics. If at any point during this lab (or any other lab!) you become stuck, please ask for assistance from myself or any of the demonstrators. We are here to help! This module uses the Code::Blocks IDE which you will be familiar with from first year. However, for a quick refresher see the step by step guide to installing and using Code::Blocks on the module web page. Please work your way through the remaining sections and complete all of the exercises. Protip: when working though the exercisers try to maintain zero warnings. If you want I can even show you how to make the compiler even more pedantic, forcing you to write clearer code.
