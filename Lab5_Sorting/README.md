# Lab 5 : Sorting

## Info
My source files for lab five have diappeared, should of started using git earlier.

## Introduction

> "So far we have implemented an unsorted list abstract data type using two types of data structure; array list and linked list. However, as has been discussed in the previous lecture, maintaining a sorted list has the advantage that searching for elements in the list can be much more efficiently implemented. In this lab we will extend our array list so that it can be used as a sorted list implementation. Open up your previous List code::blocks project and re-familiarise yourself with the code. We will be adding functionality to the array list implementation of this project during the lab. Before starting set the build target to “ArrayList” and add any implementations to arrayList.c."
