# Lab 3 : Array Lists

## Introduction

> "In the last lecture we discussed the list abstract data type and how it can be implemented using an array data structure. In this Lab we will be implementing such a list abstract data type using an array data structure. It is important to note that the list abstract data type can also be implemented using other data structures, as we will see in future labs. Please work your way though the remaining sections and complete all of the exercises. Ask for assistance if you become stuck at any point!"
