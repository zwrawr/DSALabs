# Lab 4 : Linked Lists

## Introduction

    In the last lab we implemented the list abstract data type using an array data structure. In this lab we will be implementing the same list abstract data type but this time as a double linked list data structure. This lab will help reinforce the concept that abstract data types are implementation agnostic and can be implemented using a range of data structures. Please work your way though the remaining sections and complete all of the exercises. Ask for assistance if you become stuck at any point! If there are any C functions used which you do not recognise, an excellent online resource is http://www.cplusplus.com/ which has a search facility in the lower right of the page.
