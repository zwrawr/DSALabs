# Lab 6 : Divide And Conquer

## Introduction

    In the last lecture we discussed the divide and conquer paradigm of recursively spiting larger problems into smaller problems until they can be easily solved. In this lab we will be investigating the use of two divide and conquer based algorithms: binary search and quick sort. We will also empirically investigate their performance as the input size scales. To complete this lab you will need an array list implementation which can dynamically resize. If you did not add this functionality to your array list then please do so now or download the sample solution from lab 5 from the module web page. Open up your previous List code::blocks project and re-familiarise yourself with the code. We will be adding functionality to our array list implementation during the lab so set the build target appropriately and add any new function implementations to arrayList.c.
